Receiving the support of Russia, they have pushed the Ottoman Empire to its borders of 400 years ago, after a four-year of war from 1826 to 1830. Thereupon, the radicalists, who were dissatisfied with the situation, overthrew the sultan and established a republic, but after 5 years of internal turmoil, they were not able to establish legitimacy.
